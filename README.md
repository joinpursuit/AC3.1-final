# JavaScript Fundamentals Final

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/93f76219ecfe4d4187a476fc5f7b5861)](https://www.codacy.com/app/nmadd/AC3-1-final?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=C4Q/AC3.1-final&utm_campaign=badger)

This is a closed book final - do not consult any notes, previous code, or other outside sources.

## Setup
- Fork this repo
- Clone it to your local computer
- `npm install`
- After you have finished the above two steps, turn your internet OFF

## Instructions
There are TWO parts to this final. You must complete BOTH for full credit:

1) Complete the 'short-answers' section located in the 'short-answers.md' file. Type your answers directly in that file.

2) Complete the 'coding-problems' section located in the 'coding-problems.js' file. Type your answers directly in that file.

Tests are automatically setup for you (in the 'test/challenge-problems-tests.js' file), so you can instantly see if your answers are correct (note: even if your answer does not pass the test you may still earn partial credit, so do not get discouraged if you are unable to pass some of the tests).

Run the tests by running `npm test` (you can also just run `mocha` from the command line). This should automatically run your tests for you whenever you answers file changes.

## Submission
- After you have completed your exam, notify your instructor. They will then check to make sure you have completed everything. Do this before turning your internet back on.
- Submit a pull request with your completed assessment.
